👋 Hi, I’m Arandelle Paguinto, an IT student at Cavite State University, Tanza Campus 

👀 I started creating React.js projects during my capstone project and found a deep passion for this technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js to enhance my front-end development skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving both front-end and back-end development.

📫 You can reach me via email at topaguintsarandell@gmail.com.
