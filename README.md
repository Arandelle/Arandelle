👋 Hi, I’m Arandelle Paguinto, an IT student from Cavite State University, Tanza Campus 

👀 I started creating React js and React Native projects during my capstone project and found a deep passion for this technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning javascript to enhance my knowledge on fundamentals of this language.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving both front-end and back-end development.
