👋 Hi, I’m Arandelle Paguinto, an aspiring IT student from Cavite State University, Tanza Campus.

👀 I started creating projects using React js and React Native projects during my undergraduate capstone project and found a deep passion for these technology.

🔥 Additionally, I am starting learning about the firebase realtime database and firebase storage, also curious how start creating an AI

🌱 I’m currently learning javascript frameworks and other stack to enhance my knowledge on fundamentals of these language.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving both front-end and back-end development. Also, looking for new technologies to upskill, I prefer an AI or any machine learning
